-- Notes
uSE npx expo-doctor
actually pay attention to allerts
make sure react-native-reanimated is right version --> also prevents app from starting up but at least you get error message
make sure react-native-gesture handler is right version
make sure react-native-confetti is not used as it's not validated by expo -> this prevents app from starting up and you get no error message

Even though "react-native-viewpager": "^0.2.13" is not updated, must install for top tabs to work
